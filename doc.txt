Bugs:
- Potential issues with removing tabs. When removing tabs, if the internal structure is not updated and we make a call like looping through all the children and calling chrome.tabs.XXX(undefined) it might cause some issues.
A good way to fix that is to return chromeTabs instead of InternalTabs when making manipulations with chrome.tabs
